The While Loop:
    Allows a programmer to execute a block of code repeatedly while a certain condition is true. 
Syntax: 
    While condition:
        #block of code

The For Loop:
    It is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.
Syntax:
    for item in sequence:
        #block of code

For Loop vs. While Loop:
    For loops are typically used when you know the number of iterations in advance or want to iterate over a sequence of values. You could use a for loop when you want to perform a fixed number of tasks or iterate over a list, tuple, or string.

    While loops, on the other hand, are typically used when you don't know the number of iterations in advance or want to iterate until a certain condition is met. You could use a while loop when you want to perform a task until a certain condition is met or keep prompting the user for input until they enter a valid value.

Rule to remeber for "FOR" loop:
for i in range(start, stop, step)
    Case 1: If the step is positive
        start < stop
    Case 2: If the step is negative
        start > stop
