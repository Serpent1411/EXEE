Machine Learning:
    It is like teaching computers to think. With it computers can learn from data, identify the patterns, and making predictions and decision without being told what to do.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning:
    It's like teaching the computer using labeled data and based on that data it makes decisions.
2. Unsupervised Learning:
    It looks for patterns and relatioships in the data own its own, upon which it makes the decisions.
3. Reinforcement Learning:
    A method to train the computer to learn by trail and error. In this computer learns by interacting with an enviornment and receives reward for making decision.

Supervised Learning:
    It involves training a computer to make prediction based on the labeled data. The labeled data contains both inout and output for example images of dog with lable and other objects/living things labeled as not dog. This helps the computer to learn the patterns and make decisions.

    It is used in many applications such as image recognition, fraud detection and natural language proessing. It is a powerful tool used to make decisions based on the historical data.
